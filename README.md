## My process

Decided early on to generate/populate the activity-cards HTML elements programmatically using the supplied data from JSON file.
A "hardcoded" approach with markup in the HTML + populating merely data might have been an easier solution.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Async Fetch

### What I learned

- Learned how to create and append HTML elements through Javascript code.

### Useful resources

- [MDN article on data attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes) - How to use data attributes
- [MDN article on appending elements to parent element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/append) - Appending HTML elements
